## Initial Feedback 

### Project idea
Your project idea is a little niche, so your direct target market probably isn't **huge**, but that is ok as long as you know what you are getting yourselves into. I think it is interesting as it is a very common topic for works that have been turned into movies and people are pretty vocal about it. I think the idea of making your ratings available as a service for other movie related sites is really interesting and would give your project some uniqueness. I don't know of any other groups planning to provide a public API

### Scope of work
The size of the overall work **seems** reasonable, but without having the MVP features clearly differentiated from the stretch-goal features makes it hard to tell. Please figure out what your MVP is and which features will be stretch goals. This not only help to make sure that you have a working deliverable on project due date, but, more importantly, helps your team to focus on the most critical features first.

### Docs
Overall, your start on the docs looks good, but PLEASE remove all of the templated stuff from the README.md that isn't relevant to your project. The page is difficult to read with all that extra stuff in there.

For your benefit, keep those up-to date as you make decisions and refine your designs. Use your `integrations.md` file to keep track of any useful information that you find about setting-up and configuring the integrations. These can be a pain to figure out sometimes, document it so it is easy for your other team members and for you later when you forget... If you all use these docs as THE place that you put any and all documentation about your project, it will be easier for you all to stay on the same page.
