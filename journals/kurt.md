Today the group colabed on the models for the Django app. Also I pair programed with Gio and Edgar on the model encoders and the one of the first views. We were able to sort out a spelling bug and get insomnia to return a GET and a POST response.

Gio and I finished working on the views. We used the live share coding for the first time. It worked out really well. We are having an issue where when we make an insomia request we are getting an object of type User is not JSON serializable. The requests were working yesterday so something we did today broke them.
We have hit a blocker when it comes to authentication of users. I think we are all going to workon that tomorrow.

We ran into a lot of problems today. The first was a problem with React. We had to get SIER help. This took around 2 hours to fix. After lunch we ran into a merge conflict that somehow made it into our code in the main branch.
Gio and I are currently working on reasearching how to set up our third party api's in Django.
