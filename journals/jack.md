    In the morning after the lecture, we all worked as a team to comlete our four models through Django. It took us until a few minutes before lunch to comlete the models. After the lunch break, we discussed how we wanted to begin splitting up the workload, and eventually agreed to work in pair programming. Me and Michael worked on installing the API key for the Comic Vine API to gather information on source materials involving comics while Gio, Kurt, and Edgar worked on the views. After me and Michael completed the API, we began working on the home page and mapping out how we can display the reviews of users on the home page. We found information on Bootstrap that wa useful to create cards with desired information and began prepping the code for React. However, we are at a halt due to needing necessary information to complete the page by populating it with the proper information provided by the models, views, and urls. After attendence at 5, Kurt and I began working on the other GET, PUT, and DELETE methods for the reviews which we were able to complete and push to the main branch before 7.

    Completed: Models

    Working to Complete: Views, Home Page
