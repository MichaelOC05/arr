What we did today and problems we had run into: 

We set up journals for everyone and set up the monolith services along with the docker and docker 
files. Discussed model designs and prepped coding for tomorrows work. 
Had trouble setting up docker and yaml files and datbaseURLS but fixed by changing it to match directory names
