What we did and problems we ran into:

We set up the models together, and then we split into groups. Kurt, edgar and I made model encoders and views for the review model.
One problem we ran into was that our review didnt want to return an empty dictionary, and the solution was that I misspelled django in the import for the http method.
Another problem we faced was that when we created a POST request it would give us a 403 forbidden error and we fixed it but commenting out django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware
